<h2> <center> It is our first year working with FIRST Robotics Competitions, and we're so excited! We have enjoyed building our robot and celebrating our accomplishments. Through robotics, weâ€™ve learned mechanical engineering skills, programming skills, problem solving skills, organization skills, and how to manage, market, and budget projects. We are grateful for everyone who's helped to make Herobotix possible. </center> </h2>
